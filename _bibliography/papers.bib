	abstract = {Context Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) technology is evolving rapidly, meeting modern transportation needs and driving economic and technological progress. V2V brings numerous benefits, enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with infrastructure like Roadside Units (RSUs), which helps minimize collisions, reduce fatalities, and boost road safety for passengers, drivers, and pedestrians alike. Beyond safety, V2V improves traffic management and optimizes routes. However, these advancements also introduce new challenges. Greater reliance on IT makes vehicles more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and increases costs related to system installation and maintenance. This highlights a pressing need to advance V2V technology to enhance overall safety. Objective This research focuses on identifying the primary challenges and effective practices within Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. Method We conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) using tailored search strings derived from our research questions. This process adhered to all standard MLR steps, including protocol development, initial and final selection, quality assessment, data extraction, and synthesis. Results We have identified a list of 18 challenges in the context of V2V communication. 10 of these challenges were marked as critical challenges based on the criterion of ≥20\% occurrences in both formal and grey literature. We also identified related practices for the identified critical challenges. The identified challenges were further analyzed based on different variables such as publication periods and study strategies. Conclusion We recommend that automotive industries should prioritize addressing these challenges to enhance their readiness for secure V2V communication. Our overarching goal is to develop a Cybersecurity Challenges Mitigation Model (CCMM) based on MLR findings and industrial survey outcomes, assisting companies in the automobile sector to assess their readiness for secure V2V communication development.},
