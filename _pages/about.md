I’m a passionate researcher with a European Ph.D. in Computer Science, Control, and Geoinformation from the University of Rome “Tor Vergata.” These days, I’m part of the M3S Cloud Group at the University of Oulu, where I focus on secure software engineering, using large language models, and diving into the exciting world of quantum software engineering.

I love teaching and mentoring, it’s incredibly rewarding to help shape the next generation of tech enthusiasts. Outside the lab, I’m all about bridging the digital divide, promoting tech literacy, and finding ways to preserve cultural heritage through community-driven projects. At the heart of it all, my goal is simple: to combine technology, education, and social impact to help build a more connected and inclusive future.
