Born on May 29, 1997, I have always been a passionate and multifaceted individual, deeply drawn to literature, numbers, technology, and music. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in "Computer Science, Control, and Geoinformation" at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, where my fervor for software engineering has found its home.

Within the realm of computer science, I am driven by the intricate art of software engineeing, involving reverse engineering, code refactoring, effort estimation and software architecture design. My research aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of software systems, focusing on Artificial Intelligence for Secure Software Engineering and I'm committed to contributing valuable insights to this field.

Teaching and mentorship hold a special place in my heart. As a teaching assistant, I guide and inspire budding computer scientists, nurturing their talents and fostering a love for technology.

Beyond academia, I actively engage in social initiatives, leveraging technology to bridge the digital divide and promote technological literacy in underserved communities. I also dedicate my time to preserving culture, national identity, and community unity through various projects and events.

In essence, my life revolves around my passions for technology, education, and community development, with a focus on software reengineering, teaching, and meaningful social engagement.
