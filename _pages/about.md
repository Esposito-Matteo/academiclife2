Born May 29, 1997, I have always been passionate and multifaceted, deeply drawn to literature, numbers, technology, and music. I hold a Ph.D. in "Computer Science, Control, and Geoinformation" from University of Tome "Tor Vergata". I started my new academic life chapter at the University of Oulu as a Researcher in the M3S Cloud Group!

Within computer science, I am driven by the intricate art of software engineering, involving reverse engineering, code refactoring, effort estimation, and software architecture design. My research aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of software systems, focusing on artificial intelligence for secure software engineering. I'm committed to contributing valuable insights to this field.

Teaching and mentorship hold a special place in my heart. As a teaching assistant, I guide and inspire budding computer scientists, nurturing their talents and fostering a love for technology.

Beyond academia, I actively engage in social initiatives, leveraging technology to bridge the digital divide and promote technological literacy in underserved communities. Through various projects and events, I also dedicate time to preserving culture, national identity, and community unity.

In essence, my life revolves around my passions for technology, education, and community development, with a focus on software engineering, teaching, and meaningful social engagement.
